## Usage

### Step 1: Add LLM_API_KEY secret

1. Go to your repository's Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add a new secret with:
   - Name: `LLM_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your API key from one of these providers:
     - [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (Claude)
     - [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (GPT-4)
     - [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikeys) (Gemini)

### Step 2: Create GitHub Workflow

Add this GitHub Action to your repository by creating `.github/workflows/presubmit.yml`:

```yaml
name: Presubmit.ai

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check required secrets
        run: |
          if [ -z "${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}" ]; then
            echo "Error: LLM_API_KEY secret is not configured"
            exit 1
          fi
      - uses: presubmit/ai-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
          LLM_MODEL: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
```

The action requires:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Your API key (added in step 1)
- `LLM_MODEL`: Which LLM model to use. Make sure the model is [supported](https://github.com/presubmit/ai-reviewer/blob/main/src/ai.ts) and matches the `LLM_API_KEY`.

### GitHub Enterprise Server Support

If you're using GitHub Enterprise Server, you can configure the action to work with your instance by adding these environment variables:

```yaml
      - uses: presubmit/ai-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_API_URL: "https://github.example.com/api/v3"
          GITHUB_SERVER_URL: "https://github.example.com"
```

You can also configure these settings using input parameters:

```yaml
      - uses: presubmit/ai-reviewer@latest
        with:
          github_api_url: "https://github.example.com/api/v3"
          github_server_url: "https://github.example.com"
```

Make sure to replace `https://github.example.com` with your actual GitHub Enterprise Server URL.
